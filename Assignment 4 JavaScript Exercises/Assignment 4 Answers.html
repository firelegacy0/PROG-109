<h2>Answer for Part 1: Questions A</h2>

<p>a) Output: undefined <br>
    Explanation: It is undefined, because the variable type of variable z is not defined nor given a value in this case. 
   
    <br>
    <br>

    b) Output: false <br>
    Explanation: It displays false. The !! logical operator checks the <em>truth of a value</em>. Booleans are stored as 1(true) or 0(false). For example if we did alert(!!"yes"), it shows as true, because there is nothing false about the string "yes".

    <br>
    <br>

    c) Output: 1 <br>
    Explanation: Alert displays the evaluated expression of 7%2, which is "what is the remainder of 7 divided by 2", which the answer is 1.

    <br>
    <br>

    d) Output: Wanda Smith <br>
    Explanation: A variable called name is given the String "Wanda". <br>
    alert(name+" Smith") displays the evaluated expression of name + " Smith", which concatenates the String " Smith" to the variable Wanda, then returns the combined result which is Wanda Smith.

    <br>
    <br>

    e) Output: 52 <br>
    Explanation: A variable called myNum is given the String "5". (not integer or number!) <br>
    alert(myNum+2) displays the evaluated expression of myNum+2, which concatenates the String "5" with an integer 2, which produces 5 and 2, resulting 52. It is not 7 because "5" is a String and not a number.
</p>

<h2> Answer for Part 2: Questions B </h2>
<p> 1) They are two different languages with several differences, for example: <br>
    - Java is a compiled language, while JavaScript is a script language <br>
    - Java is heavily object-oriented language, while JavaScript is mostly procedural with some support for object-oriented and functional programming. <br>
    - JavaScript is primarily used for front-end development, while Java is used for object-oriented programming, such as class inheritance, or back-end developments.  <br>

    <br>

    2) + is addition operator, ++ is increment operator. For example, if given x = 5 <br>
    If we did y = x+3 , it evaluates into 5+3, resulting 8 <br>
    If we did y = ++x, it evaluates into increment 5 by 1, resulting in 6 <br>

    <br>

    3) All these 3 are different methods. <br>
    console.log() outputs whatever is passed as the parameter, for example console.log("testing"), will output "test" to console. <br>
    document.write() prints to website, for example document.write("Hello"), prints the message Hello on website. <br>
    window.alert() is a popup alert that requires the user to click Ok to continue, for example window.alert("1"), will alert the message 1 as a popup alert. <br>
    
    <br>

    4) These 3 are different operators. <br>
    = is assignment operator, which is used to assign values to variable, for example x = 5, assigns 5 to x. <br>
    == (equal to) is comparison operator, it compares two variables irrespective of the data type and return the result as a boolean. For example 1 == "1" returns true, because they are same value of 1. <br>
    === is a comparison operator that checks both data type and the value and return the result as a boolean. For example 1 === "1" returns false, because 1 is a number, "1" is a String. <br>

    <br>

    5) These are two somewhat similar but different Looping Structures used to repeat statements. <br>
    While loop: <br>
    -Tests the condition at beginning of loop, if condition is true, it executes statements inside loop. This means the While loop only executes statements in the code block <em>ONLY if condition is True.</em> <br>

    Do-While Loop: <br>
    -At the end of the loop, Do While Loop tests for the condition. In short, Do While execute statements in the code block at least once even if condition fails.
