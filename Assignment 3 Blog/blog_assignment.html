            <h2 id="doge">What, or Who is Doge?</h2><br>
            <p><i>Doge</i> was an Internet meme that became popular in 2013, the meme is a picture of a <i>Shiba Inu breed</i> dog accompanied
                by multicolored text in Comic Sans font.<br>
                The text represents a kind of internal monologue, and is often written in broken English,
                 emphasizing words like "so", "such", "many", "much", and "very".
            </p><br>
            
            <p>It's popularity was believed to be influenced by the peculiar look the animal had at the camera<em>--is it happy to see me or is it secretly judging me?</em><br>
                <i>Kabosu</i>, a female <i>Shiba Inu</i> is the dog featured in this meme, was a rescue dog adopted by Atsuko Sato from Japan.<br>
                The images originated from the owner's blog sharing various pictures of <i>Kabosu</i>, while this one caught the Internet's attention in particular.

            <h2 id="shiba">What about Shiba Inu?</h2><br>
            <p> <i> Shiba Inu </i> is small-to-medium sized dog. it is one of the smallest of the six original and distinct Spitz breeds native to Japan.<br> 
                While it is small, it is very agile and muscular that copes well in mountainous terrain, originally bred for hunting animals like Wild Boars.  
            </p><br>

            <p>The term <i> Shiba </i> means brushwood in Japanese, and many drawn similarities of its name to its brushwood color similar to shrubs.<br>	
                Its frame is compact with well-developed muscles, and is <i>double coated</i>--the outer coat being stiff and straight, while the undercoat is soft and thick.<br>
